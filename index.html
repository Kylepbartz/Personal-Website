		<div>Hello WOrld. My name is Kyle and Since I was just a small boy in Milwaukee, I have had a passion for music and recording. After earning a BAchelors degree from FULL Sail University in recording arts, I began work at RAX TRAX Studio in Chicago as an assistant engineer. Upon receiving an offer to work for apple in their retail store, I quickly fell in love with teaching and was promoted to a training role. This amazing opportunity allowed me to dive into the nuances of how adults learn in formal training settings like Train-the-trainer, workshops, and video. When my wife was offered a position in Austin, TX, I dropped everything and reassessed how i Could use my training skills in instructional design on our exciting journey. graciously, I accepted a position with Whole foods market as an assistant instructional designer with an incredibly capable team before taking contracts with Apple and google respectively. 

Technology and music are my passions and Instructional design has been my bridge in connecting others to the information they need</div>

		<div>The videos below were created using VYond and are intended to demonstrate aptitude within the software.

The first video was created as part of a training on food safety distributed to whole foods stores in the USA, Canada, and the UK. 

The second and third videos were created as a pet project to practice the vyond platform and perfect various animation techniques. They follow an alien robot with an australian accent named milo who is trying to make sense of humans and their bizzare culture. Enjoy.
